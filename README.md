- 👋 Hi, I’m Radu @sinnerJoe. I'm a full-stack developer with experience in React, Angular 2+, Nodejs and a bit of rails.
- 👀 I’m interested in implementing beautiful interactive apps, I love running, swimming and football, although as I get older it's getting hard  
 to find people that share my desire to play football. I like reading self-help and classical books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust in order to fulfill my dream of implementing a game from the ground-up with it. Also I'm trying to learn handstand
because it's one of my childhood dreams ⭐.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that spark my interest. I'd like to do something lower level because I don't get to write 
system software on my job as a web developer :)
- 📫 Reach me via email on ianknote@protonmail.com or via linkedin
